/**
 * Abstract base class for a noise-map builder
 * <p/>
 * A builder class builds a noise map by filling it with coherent-noise
 * values generated from the surface of a three-dimensional mathematical
 * object.  Each builder class defines a specific three-dimensional
 * surface, such as a cylinder, sphere, or plane.
 * <p/>
 * A builder class describes these input values using a coordinate system
 * applicable for the mathematical object (e.g., a latitude/longitude
 * coordinate system for the spherical noise-map builder.)  It then
 * "flattens" these coordinates onto a plane so that it can write the
 * coherent-noise values into a two-dimensional noise map.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Building the Noise Map</b>
 * <p/>
 * To build the noise map, perform the following steps:
 * - Pass the bounding coordinates to the SetBounds() method.
 * - Pass the noise map size, in points, to the SetDestSize() method.
 * - Pass a NoiseMap object to the SetDestNoiseMap() method.
 * - Pass a noise module (derived from noise::module::Module) to the
 * SetSourceModule() method.
 * - Call the Build() method.
 * <p/>
 * You may also pass a callback function to the SetCallback() method.
 * The Build() method calls this callback function each time it fills a
 * row of the noise map with coherent-noise values.  This callback
 * function has a single integer parameter that contains a count of the
 * rows that have been completed.  It returns void.
 * <p/>
 * Note that SetBounds() is not defined in the abstract base class; it is
 * only defined in the derived classes.  This is because each model uses
 * a different coordinate system.
