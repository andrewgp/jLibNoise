/**
 * Defines a color gradient.
 * <p/>
 * A color gradient is a list of gradually-changing colors.  A color
 * gradient is defined by a list of <i>gradient points</i>.  Each
 * gradient point has a position and a color.  In a color gradient, the
 * colors between two adjacent gradient points are linearly interpolated.
 * <p/>
 * To add a gradient point to the color gradient, pass its position and
 * color to the AddGradientPoint() method.
 * <p/>
 * To retrieve a color from a specific position in the color gradient,
 * pass that position to the GetColor() method.
 * <p/>
 * This class is a useful tool for coloring height maps based on
 * elevation.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Gradient example</b>
 * <p/>
 * Suppose a gradient object contains the following gradient points:
 * <p/>
 * - -1.0 maps to black.
 * - 0.0 maps to white.
 * - 1.0 maps to red.
 * <p/>
 * If an application passes -0.5 to the GetColor() method, this method
 * will return a gray color that is halfway between black and white.
 * <p/>
 * If an application passes 0.25 to the GetColor() method, this method
 * will return a very light pink color that is one quarter of the way
 * between white and red.
