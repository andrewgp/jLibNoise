/**
 * Builds a spherical noise map.
 * <p/>
 * This class builds a noise map by filling it with coherent-noise values
 * generated from the surface of a sphere.
 * <p/>
 * This class describes these input values using a (latitude, longitude)
 * coordinate system.  After generating the coherent-noise value from the
 * input value, it then "flattens" these coordinates onto a plane so that
 * it can write the values into a two-dimensional noise map.
 * <p/>
 * The sphere model has a radius of 1.0 unit.  Its center is at the
 * origin.
 * <p/>
 * The x coordinate in the noise map represents the longitude.  The y
 * coordinate in the noise map represents the latitude.
 * <p/>
 * The application must provide the southern, northern, western, and
 * eastern bounds of the noise map, in degrees.
